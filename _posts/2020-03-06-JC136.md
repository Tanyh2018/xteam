The JC-136 paper introduces the usage, advantages of TRACS and some theory of the simulation. 
TRACS is a multi-threading software based on the Shockley-Ramo’s theorem to simulate non-irradiated and irradiated silicon micro-strips and pad detectors of complex geometries. 
It helps understand signal formation and charge collection efficiencies of arbitrary charge distributions. 

- Describe the state of art where TRACS is framed. 
- Describe the scope and operation modes of the software. 
- Explain the theoretical background of TRACS, mainly based on Shockley–Ramo’s theorem for the calculation of the induced current. 
- Numerical methods used to approximate the differential equations are explained and related with the code. 
- Introduce multithreading computation in TRACS. 
- Contain a comparison of TRACS to measured data.
