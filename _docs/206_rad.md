## Radiation Hardness 

### NIEL

The particle energy deposition mechanisms by ionization and non-ionization processes are reviewed as well as the radiation-induced damage and its effect on device parameters evolution, depending on particle type, energy and fluence. The temporary or permanent damage inflicted by a single particle (single event effect) to electronic devices or integrated circuits is treated separately from the total ionizing dose (TID) effect for which the accumulated fluence causes degradation and from the displacement damage induced by the non-ionizing energy-loss (NIEL) deposition. Under most of radiation level of collider detector, the NIEL dominants decrease of detector performance. Here introduce the NIEL hypothesis which normalize the value from one particle to another, or from one energy to another for the same type particle.

The Non Ionising Energy Loss NIEL hypothesis allows a first-order normalization
of radiation damage with respect to different particles or particles with different energy.
According to NIEL, the damage manifestation depends only on energy
transferred in collisions regardless of particle energy and type.

$$
\kappa=\frac{\int D(E) \phi(E) d E}{95 M e V m b \cdot \Phi}=\frac{\Phi_{e q}}{\Phi}
$$

where $$\kappa$$ is defined as the ratio of the individual damage particle factor for a given energy and 1 MeV neutrons; $$D(E)$$ is displacement damage function; $$\Phi_{e q}$$ is the 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluence; $$\Phi(E)$$ is particle fluence with energy $$E$$.

The 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluence s then calculated by

$$
\Phi_{e q}=\kappa \Phi=\kappa \int \phi(E) d E ; \quad\left[\Phi_{e q}\right]=n_{1 \mathrm{MeV}} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}
$$

Such as 100 MeV proton equivalent fluences 

$$
D(E=100 \mathrm{MeV})_{\text {proton }}=1.276 \times D(E=1 \mathrm{MeV})_{\text {neutron }}[95 \mathrm{MeV} \mathrm{mb}]
$$

$$
\Phi_{\text {proton }}\left[n_{1MeV}/ c m^{2}\right]=\frac{\Phi_{\text {neutron }}}{1.276}\left[n_{1MeV}/ c m^{2}\right]
$$
