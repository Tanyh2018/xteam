The time resolution of a detector is largely given by jitter contribution and time walk contribution.  

1.The jitter contribution is determined by the ratio of the rise time of the signal waveform and signal to noise ratio. Due to the detector cell of 3D detector is only about 30 $$\mu$$ m, the rise time is small. When the signal to noise ratio is small, the jitter contribution to time resolution is relatively more important and possibly even dominant. When the signal to noise is enough (like Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGAD)), the jitter contribution can be ignored.


2.The time work contribution is caused by the difference in signal height and signal shapes. 
- The difference in signal height can be reduced by using Constant Fraction Discrimination(CFD). 
- The signal shapes are mainly affected by the differences in drift paths of generated carriers. Fluctuations in ionization rates along the track path (Landau fluctuations) add to the differences in pulse shapes. In 3D detectors, Landau fluctuations are less important because of charges generated at different depths have the same drift distance to the collection electrode. The time walk contribution mainly depends on the location of the mpact within the cell of the detector. <sup>[1]</sup>


The conclusion is that the time walk contribution for time resolution of 3D semiconductor detector is mainly given by the location of impact within the detector.

## The time resolution simulation of silicon detector
The time resolution simulation of silicon detector is essential for designing and improving timing detector. The simulation can predict the operation of silicon detector to a certain extent. The simulation consists of four parts: electric and weighting field calculation, the charge generation by incident particles, the drift of the generated charge, and the readout electronics.
### 1. Electric and Weighting Field Calculation
The electic potential $$ V_{E} $$  at a point "A" in a static electric filed $$ E $$ is given by:
$$
V_{E}=-\int_{C}\Edl \label{eq1}
$$
where C is the path connecting the ponit 

with zero potential.  According to the Gauss's law and Poisson's equation, the electric potential statisfies:
$$ -\nabla^{2}V_{E} = \rho/\varepsilon_{0}    \label{eq2}$$ 
where $$\rho$$ is the total charge density, and $$varepsilon_{0}$$ is permittivity of vacuum.
if the material of detector is silicon and the effective concentration of the detector is $$ N_{eff}. The equation becomes:
$$-\nabla^{2}V_{E} = \frac{e_{0}N_{eff}}{\varepsilon_{S_{i}}\varepsilon_{0}}  \label{eq3}$$

$$E=-\nablaV_{E}   \label{eq4}$$

At the borders of simulated volume, the voltage is same on the both sides of the electrode and the edge interface. The boundary conditions were:
$$
\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}=0,\frac{\partial U}{\partial y}=0,\frac{\partial U}{\partial z}=0  \label{eq5}
$$
where the U is the voltage of the electrode.

The weighting field $$E_{w}$$ is a measure of electrostatic coupling between the point "A" and the detector electrode. The weighting potential $$U_{w}$$ is the ratio of the "A" potential and the electrode potential after one or more potentials and charges are changed.
