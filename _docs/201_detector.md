## What is the Detector for Particle Physics Experiment?
Detectors used in particle physics experiments extract signals in the
form of either photons or electrical current when particles pass through the detector material.
In addition, precise timing resolution is demanded especially for experiments in modern era
which is the characteristic different from others, for example,  some of key detectors
used in astrophysics having long timing gate, human eyes etc.
Capability of reproducing the event topology by means of hit position information
is also commonly required for the particle detectors.   <br>

Those detectors are classifiable from several perspective, and the following examples are some of the typical classification. <br>


### Classification of detectors by signals:          <br>
1. #### 1a) Producing photons as signal
  - Cherenkov detectors (RICH)            
  - ...                                   
2. #### 1b) Producing electrical current as signal   
  - Silicon detectors                     
  - ...                                   

### Classification of detectors by measurement purposes:   <br>
#### 2a) Measurement of particle Momentum  <br>
#### 2b) Measurement of particle Vertex    <br>
#### 2c) Measurement of particle Energy    <br>
#### 2d) Measurement of particle ID        <br>
