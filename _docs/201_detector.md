## What is the Detector for Particle Physics Experiment? 
Detectors used in particle physics experiments extract signals in the 
form of either photons or electrical current when particles pass detector material. In addition, fine timing resolution is demanded especially in modern experiments which is the characteristic different from others, for example,  some of key detectors used in astrophysics with wide timing gate, human eyes etc. Capability of recording information regarding event topology is also commonly required for the particle detectors. 

Classification of detectors;    <br>
1a) detectors of photon signal  <br>
1b) detectors of electrical current  <br>  
<br>

2a) for Momentum measurement <br>
2b) for Vertex measurement  <br>
2c) for Energy measurement  <br>
2d) for Particle ID measurement <br>
