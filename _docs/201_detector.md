## What is the Detector for Particle Physics Experiment?
Detectors widely used in particle physics experiments extract signals in the
form of either photons or electrical current when particles pass through the detector material.
In addition, precise timing resolution is demanded especially for experiments in modern era
which is the characteristic different from others, for example,  some of key detectors
used in astrophysics having long timing gate, human eyes etc.
Capability of reproducing the event topology by means of hit position information
is also commonly required for the particle detectors.   <br>

Those detectors are classifiable from several perspective, and the following examples are some of the typical classification. <br>


## Classification of detectors by signals:          
### 1a) Producing photons as signal
  - Cherenkov detectors (RICH, ...)            
  - Counters (TOF, ...)   

### 1b) Producing electrical current as signal   
  - Silicon detectors (pixel/microstrip, ...)                   
  - Wire chambers (MWDC, ...), TPC
  - ...

<br>  

## Classification of detectors by measurement purposes:   
### 2a) Measurement of particle Momentum  
  - Silicon strip detectors
  - Drift chambers  

### 2b) Measurement of particle Vertex    
  - Silicon pixel detectors

### 2c) Measurement of particle Energy    
  - Calorimeters (ECal/HCal)

### 2d) Measurement of particle ID          
  - Drift chambers
  - TOFs
  - RICH
  - ...

## Silicon Carbide
### 3a）Crystal structure of silicon carbide
Unlike silicon, SiC has different crystal structures called polytypes , like 3C、4H、6H .  <br>

In a hexagonal crystal, four Miller indices are used to define a direction: a1, a2, a3, and c. 
However, a1, a2, and a3 depend on each other with the relationship: a1 + a2 + a3 = 0.
Therefore, it is sufficient to use only three of the four Miller indices to determine any direction. 
For example, the direction [1120] is specified as {1 1 0}, omitting the third Miller index.  <br>

### 3b) Layer structure of SiC
Both 4H-SiC and 6H-SiC lattices are formed by a corresponding number of cubic and hexagonal bonds 
with a stacking sequences of ABCB (4H-SiC) or ABCACB (6H-SiC), as shown in Figure 2.

The direction of accumulation along the upward direction is the C-axis in the previous image, i.e. [0001] direction.

### 3c) Miscut angle
In the process of silicon carbide wafer production, the crystal growth is not completely along the normal direction of the wafer surface,
but there is an angle between the growth direction and the normal direction of the wafer surface.This Angle can be called a miscut Angle.
The miscut angle is usually in the range of 3.5 - 8.5°.
